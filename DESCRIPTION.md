Prediction Models Collection
===========================

This folder contains a curated set of small-to-medium machine learning projects covering common supervised learning tasks (classification and regression). Each project includes a Jupyter notebook demonstrating data loading, exploratory data analysis, model training and evaluation, and a CSV dataset used by the notebook.

Included projects
-----------------
- Breast Cancer Prediction — notebook and data.csv for cancer diagnosis classification.
- Customer Churn Prediction — notebook and churn.csv for churn modeling.
- E-Commerce Product Delivery Prediction — notebook and E_Commerce.csv for delivery/time prediction.
- Heart Stroke Prediction — notebook and healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv for stroke risk classification.
- Hotel Reservations Cancellation Prediction — notebook and Hotel Reservations.csv for cancellation modeling.
- House Price Prediction — notebook and home_data.csv for regression on house prices.
- Indian Used Car Price Prediction — notebook and usedCars.csv for used car price prediction.
- Loan Approval Prediction — notebook and loan_approval_dataset.csv for loan decision classification.
- Medical Cost Prediction — notebook and insurance.csv for regression of medical costs.
- Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction — notebook and diabetes.csv for diabetes classification.
- Red Wine Quality — notebook and winequality-red.csv for wine quality regression/classification.
- Room Occupancy Detection — notebooks and datatraining.csv / datatest.csv / datatest2.csv for occupancy detection.
- Salary Prediction — notebook and Salary_Data_Based_country_and_race.csv for salary/regression examples.
- Sleep Disorder Prediction — notebook and Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv.
- Traffic Flow Prediction — notebook and TrafficDataset.csv for time-series / regression examples.
- Warranty Claims Fraud Prediction — notebook and df_Clean.csv for classification/fraud detection.

Purpose
-------
This collection is intended for learning and experimentation. The notebooks are self-contained demonstrations you can run in Jupyter or VS Code. Use them to study modeling workflows, reproduce results, or adapt the pipelines to your own data.

Notes
-----
- Datasets are included in each project folder as CSV files.
- Notebook environments and exact dependency lists are not provided per-project; a common Python ML stack (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn, and optionally tensorflow/keras/xgboost) will usually suffice.
